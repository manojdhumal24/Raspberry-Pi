A Stepper Motor or a step motor is a brushless, synchronous motor, which divides a full rotation into a number of steps. Unlike a brushless DC motor, which rotates continuously when a fixed DC voltage is applied to it, a step motor rotates in discrete step angles.

The stepper motor is used for precise positioning with a motor, such as hard disk drives, robotics, antennas, telescopes, and some toys. 

Stepper motors cannot run at high speeds, but have a high holding torque.
