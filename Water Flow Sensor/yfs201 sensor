Water Flow Sensor
YFS201 Hall Effect Water Flow Sensor 
This sensor sits in line with the water line and contains a pinwheel sensor to measure how much water has moved through it. There is an integrated magnetic Hall-Effect sensor that outputs an electrical pulse with every revolution. 


Flow calculation:

The basis relationship for determining the liquid’s flow rate in such cases is Q=VxA, 
Q - flow rate/total flow of water through the pipe
V - average velocity of the flow and A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe

Pulse frequency (Hz) = 7.5Q, Q is flow rate in Litres/minute – in Minute
Flow Rate (Litres/hour) = (Pulse frequency x 60 min) / 7.5Q – Q in hour


Pulses=7.5×Q
Q=Pulses/7.5 (This is flow rate in Litres/min)
Q=Pulses/(7.5×60) (This is flow rate in Litres/hour
