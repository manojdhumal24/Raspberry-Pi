An ADC converts a continuous-time and continuous-amplitude analog signal to a discrete-time and discrete-amplitude digital signal. 


The conversion involves quantization of the input, so it necessarily introduces a small amount of error or noise. 

Furthermore, instead of continuously performing the conversion, an ADC does the conversion periodically, sampling the input, limiting the allowable bandwidth of the input signal.

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is an interface bus commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripherals such as shift registers, sensors, and SD cards. 

It uses separate clock and data lines, along with a select line to choose the device you wish to talk to.
