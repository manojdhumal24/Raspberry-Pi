User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of Internet Protocol suite, referred as UDP/IP suite. 

Unlike TCP, it is unreliable and connectionless protocol. So, there is no need to establish connection prior to data transfer. 

UDP permits packets to be dropped instead of processing delayed packets. There is no error checking in UDP, so it also save bandwidth.
